# The API


## ``start``

```cl
> (lhc:start)
(#(inets ok) #(ssl ok) #(lhttpc ok) #(lhc ok))
```

This function simply starts the lhc LFE HTTP client. This is required for any
use of the lhc client library.

lhc depends upon other applications which need to be started (e.g., the
Erlang networking services, SSL support, etc.)
