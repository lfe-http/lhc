# User Agent

> The lhc user agent string:

```
"LFE Little HTTP Client/0.1.0 (LFE 0.10.0-dev; Erlang 18; backend=lhttpc) (+http://github.com/lfex/lhc)"
```

The lhc user agent will show up in any HTTP server log files where client user
agent strings are recorded. To the right is an example of the lhc user agent
string.
