# URL Functions

The ``lhc-url`` module contains functions for working with HTTP URLs

## Related Records

The ``lhc-url`` module has access to two records and the autogenerated functions of each:

* ``urldata``
* ``netloc``

While the module's functions provide most of what one needs with regard to these records, it may be useful for the developer to perform pattern matching against the record fields. As such, the fields are listed here:

* ``urldata``: scheme, netloc, path, params, query, fragment
* ``netloc``: username, password, host, port
